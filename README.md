Data Analyst Portfolio


Introduction

Hello, I'm Alain Monroy, an experienced Data Analyst with a strong background in business consulting and on my way to complete a MSc in Data Analytics at Dublin Business School. Over the past years, I've successfully applied my analytical skills to boost business performance as consultant and have been running familiar company where I leverage new knowledge gained from my MSc to enhance various aspects of operations.

Project Highlights

1. Predictive Modeling for Employee Burnout and Attrition
Abstract:
The code, executed in Google Colab, focuses on determining the best predictive model for assessing the risk of employee burnout or attrition. Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Classification were evaluated using feature selection techniques like Correlation Matrix, Chi-square, and Mutual Information Classifier. The analysis aimed to predict the risk based on the dependent variables "WorkLifeBalance" and "JobSatisfaction" for Class 1 and Class 2.

Key Achievements:
Identified top-performing models for predicting burnout risk for different employee groups.
Implemented feature selection techniques to enhance model accuracy.
Explored parameter optimization for Gaussian Naive Bayes and Support Vector Classification.
Future Considerations:
Suggested collecting more data and exploring alternative feature selection methods.
Proposed testing diverse algorithms such as Decision Trees and experimenting with different optimization techniques.

2. Billionaires Dataset Analysis

Abstract:
This analysis involves statistical techniques and machine learning models applied to a dataset related to billionaires listed in Forbes. It covers data pre-processing, GLM modeling, and time series forecasting.

Key Achievements:
Conducted thorough data pre-processing, handling missing values using imputation techniques.
Trained GLM models to predict whether an individual is self-made.
Performed time series analysis on NVIDIA Corporation's stock prices.
Future Considerations:
Highlighted the need for additional data, exploring alternative feature selection methods, and testing diverse algorithms.

3. Customer Shopping Data Analysis

Abstract:
Focused on a real-world, relational dataset representing customer shopping data, exploring it through various statistical techniques and visualizations.

Key Achievements:
Conducted descriptive analytics, including total quantity of sales and price by location.
Proposed probability models for predictive analytics.
Addressed independence of categorical variables using hypothesis tests.
